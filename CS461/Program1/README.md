# Program One - Guided Search (A* Search)
Guided Search Program that used A* Search Algorithm to find optimal path from a list of locations given their coordinates and their adjacent locations.
Assumptions:
 - Takes Input files of "Coordinates" and "Adjacencies" for the coordinates and ajacencies to be used
 - Takes given Input strings for starting and finishing locations 
 - Uses A* Search Algorithm to find path
 - Returns Output path from starting location to finishing location
